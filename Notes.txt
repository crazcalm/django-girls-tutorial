Possible issues in the django girls documentation:
- Windows command to delete files/directories? Is it "del" or "rmdir"?
  - Introduction to command line section

- Python 3.4.4 is out. Should we be using that?

- python no module _sqlite3
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1210664/no-module-named-sqlite3

- Deploy section:
  - "pip install django" instead of "pip install django==1.9"

Need to create a pull request for
1. Django.carrots.pl is not available anymore. We should update link in credits 
to them with this url: https://github.com/ggcarrots/django-carrots and remove 
them from "What's next" recommendation list.
