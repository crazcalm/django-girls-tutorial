Possible issues in the django girls documentation:
- Windows command to delete files/directories? Is it "del" or "rmdir"?
  - Introduction to command line section

- Python 3.4.4 is out. Should we be using that?

- python no module _sqlite3
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1210664/no-module-named-sqlite3

- Deploy section:
  - "pip install django" instead of "pip install django==1.9"
